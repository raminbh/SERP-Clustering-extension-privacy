    <h1>Privacy Policy for Keywords SERP Clustering Chrome Extension</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 21, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for using the Keywords SERP Clustering Chrome Extension ("the Extension"). This Privacy Policy describes how your information is collected, used, and handled when you use the Extension.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>The Extension collects the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Provided Keywords:</strong> The list of keywords you enter or paste into the Extension for the purpose of clustering.</li>
        <li><strong>ValueSERP API Key:</strong> Your personal API key for the ValueSERP service, which you provide in the Extension's settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>Your information is used solely for the core functionality of the Extension:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Your keywords are sent to the ValueSERP API service to retrieve the corresponding Google Search Engine Results Page (SERP) data. This data is then used locally within the Extension to perform the clustering analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>ValueSERP API Key:</strong> Your API key is used exclusively to authenticate requests made from the Extension to the ValueSERP API on your behalf. It allows the Extension to fetch the necessary SERP data required for clustering.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Store Your Information</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>ValueSERP API Key:</strong> Your API key is stored locally on your computer using the secure <code>chrome.storage.local</code> API provided by the Chrome browser. It is not transmitted to any servers other than ValueSERP for authentication purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Keywords you input are processed in your browser's memory during the clustering operation. They are not persistently stored by the Extension after the session ends or the Extension popup is closed, unless required for displaying current results. Clustered results are displayed within the extension and can be optionally exported by you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>

    <p>We only share your data in the following limited circumstance:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ValueSERP API:</strong> Your keywords and API key are necessarily transmitted to the ValueSERP API service (<code>api.valueserp.com</code> and <code>data.valueserp.com</code>) to retrieve the SERP data essential for the Extension's function. We do not control how ValueSERP uses this data; please refer to the <a href="https://trajectdata.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ValueSERP Privacy Policy</a> (or their relevant policy page) for details.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We <strong>do not</strong> share your keywords or API key with any other third parties. We <strong>do not</strong> sell your data.</p>

    <h2>5. User Control and Data Retention</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>You can clear the keywords entered into the Extension at any time using the "Clear All" button.</li>
        <li>You can remove your stored ValueSERP API key at any time via the Extension's settings page.</li>
        <li>Uninstalling the Extension will remove all locally stored data associated with it, including your API key.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>

    <p>We use standard browser mechanisms (<code>chrome.storage.local</code>) designed for secure local storage of sensitive data like API keys. However, please note that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Extension or on its Chrome Web Store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
